      "How do I access the AI image feature?"
    ],
    "answer": "To use the AI image generator, drag in an image component or click on an existing image block. Then click the **Generate** button.

      "Can AI read my content and build a prompt automatically?"
    ],
    "answer": "Yes. The AI can analyze your content and write a detailed image generation prompt for you. Just click the option to have it read your article, and it will create a rich descriptive prompt that is then passed to the image generator to create a matching visual."

      "Can I save AI-generated images?",
      "How do I insert a generated image into my content?",
      "What does 'Save' vs 'Save and Insert' mean?",
      "Where do my AI images get stored?"
    ],
    "answer": "After generating an image, you can either click **Save** to store it in your image library, or **Save and Insert** to both store it and insert it into your current content block. You can reuse saved images later across different articles."
  },

    "questions": [
      "Does the AI use my full article to generate images?",

      "How do I edit the content used for generating the prompt?",
      "What is the 'Edit Source' feature in image generation?"
    ],
    "answer": "By default, the tool extracts your entire article to build a prompt. But you can click **Edit Source** to manually choose which part of the content is used. This lets you fine-tune the context and control what the AI uses to create the image."
  },
  {
    "questions": [
      "Are there limits to how many AI images I can create?",
      "Is there a usage cap on image generation?",

      "Do I need to pay extra to use the AI image tool?"
    ],
    "answer": "You can generate as many images as you'd like using the AI image tool. All images are license-free, and there are no limits on usage, generation frequency, or storage inside your account."

    ],
    "answer": "The more specific your prompt, the better your results. Include subject, mood, setting, camera style, lighting, and artistic references if possible. For example: \"A 4K photo of a Labradoodle tilting its head in a sunlit kitchen\" will generate much better results than simply \"dog photo.\""
