      "Why are total opens different between the summary page and the individual report?",
      "Why donâ€™t total opens match between summary and report views?",
      "Why is the open count higher in the detailed report than on the summary page?"
    ],
    "answer": "The summary page updates once daily for performance reasons, since it pulls data across many broadcasts. Individual broadcast reports, however, show live and up-to-date engagement numbers."
