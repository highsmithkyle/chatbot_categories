    "answer": "Proze lets you embed native calendar invites directly into your emails so recipients can RSVP without downloading attachments or leaving their inbox. Invites appear automatically in their calendar as tentative and are compatible with Outlook, Apple, Yahoo, and Google calendars. You can track RSVPs, make updates, and even cancel events — all directly from the platform. Watch the full walkthrough here: https://m1.proze.io/site/proze-training/posts/calendar-invites---rsvps"
