    "question": "What is Zen Mode?",

    "question": "What does auto-upload unsubscribed mean?",
    "answer": "Each night, the system runs an auto-sync to determine which subscribers should be added or removed. If an email address does not appear on the nightly sync file, it is automatically marked as unsubscribed. The user’s profile remains in the system, but they will no longer receive messages."

  {
    "question": "What does the Clear Cache button do?",
    "answer": "This button clears the cache for the current broadcast. If you make changes to content (like updating a link) after the email is sent, clearing the cache ensures that anyone viewing it sees the updated version."

  {
    "question": "How does Proze define a “bounce”?",
    "answer": "A bounce occurs when an email cannot be delivered to a recipient’s address. This can be due to reasons such as the address not existing, a full inbox, or restrictions from the recipient’s mail server. Bounced addresses are automatically flagged in the system."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I attach a document to a Proze email?",
    "answer": "Attachments are not supported for security reasons. However, you can upload a file to the Chooser (the same place where images are uploaded) and link to it from a button in the email to achieve a similar result."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I have email replies go to multiple people?",
    "answer": "Yes. You can enter multiple email addresses in the Reply To field. Separate each address with a comma, and replies will be sent to all listed addresses."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I upload an Excel list that contains duplicate email addresses, will the system remove them automatically?",
