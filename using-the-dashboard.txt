What does the heatmap measure?

[Answer]
The heatmap shows where recipients clicked within your email. It visually maps click activity but does not track when someone hovers over an area — only actual clicks are recorded.

[Question]
What’s the best way to track a specific group’s email performance over time?

[Answer]
Create a static list with the group's email addresses, enable "Display in Dashboard" when saving the list, then use the dashboard's chart icon to track performance over time. Data updates overnight, and you can view trends by selecting custom date ranges.

[Question]
Is there a way to group emails by topic and compare performance across them in reports?

[Answer]
Yes. Use the "Edition Settings" field to add a tag to each email you want grouped. Then in Reports → Trends & Stats, filter by that tag to view combined metrics. This allows you to compare related campaigns side-by-side by total clicks, opens, etc.
