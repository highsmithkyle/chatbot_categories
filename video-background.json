    "question": "How do I use the video as a background feature?",
    "answer": "To use the video as a background feature, start by creating a new email and selecting a template. In the Template Builder Wizard, click 'Proceed' and navigate to the 'Background Video' tab. From there, choose one of the available layout options: Full Email Background Video, Header Background Video, Full-Width Header Background Video, or Rounded Header Background Video. Note that Full Email backgrounds require a minimum video size of 1000×1000 pixels, while Full-Width Header backgrounds require at least 1000×400 pixels. Once you’ve selected your layout, you’ll be taken to the edit screen. Click the blue video icon to either choose from your existing background videos or create a new one. To create a new background, click 'Add Video' to upload a clip or choose from your library, then click 'Insert'. You can trim the clip to a specific segment (for example, the first 4 seconds) and even add multiple clips if needed. On the right-hand panel, you can adjust visual effects like crop position, color overlays, and gradients. If you apply any effects, make sure to click 'Apply Effects' to save them. When you're finished, name your background video and click 'Save'. After it processes, click 'Insert' to add it to your email design."
