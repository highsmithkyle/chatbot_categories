    "answer": "Here's how to add a video background to your email:\n\n1. **Create a new edition.** You'll see tabs for different styles: Internal, External, Multipurpose, and Background Video. Select **Background Video** to begin.\n\n2. **Choose your layout.** You can pick from four layout styles:\n   - Full Email Background Video\n   - Header Background Video\n   - Full-Width Header Background Video\n   - Rounded Header Background Video\n   Select a layout to continue.\n\n3. **Customize your email layout.** This is your editable template. You can add or remove components as needed. To replace the placeholder video, click the blue **Video** button in the upper left.\n\n4. **Choose an existing video** or create a new one. If you've already created a background video, select it from the list. Otherwise, click **Create New Video** to begin.\n\n5. **Click 'Add Video'** to upload a video from your computer or select one from your existing library. Then click **Insert** to load it into your editor.\n\n6. **Set the video segment.** Choose which part of the video to use by entering a start and end time. When you're done, click **Save**.\n\n7. **(Optional) Customize the video.** You can add a color overlay, apply a gradient, or adjust the crop position. If you make any visual changes, click **Apply Effects** to save them.\n\n8. **Name and save your video.** Enter a name, click **Save**, and wait for the system to process it. Once ready, click **Insert** to add it to your email design.\n\n9. **Continue editing your email** as usual—add text, content blocks, buttons, or images as needed.\n\n10. **Still need help?** Watch the full walkthrough here: https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExMjZ4d2tzb2x2Yjc3cm1sOGFlMngwY3YxMDl5MnVqZzRhcWtxemJtdyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/l397998l2DT0ogare/giphy.gif"
